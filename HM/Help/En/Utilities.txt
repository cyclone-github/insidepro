 Hash List Manager
*******************

1. Press F2 after the program launching, and choose a folder with the hash lists.

2. You must rename the hash lists to this format:
	"xxx.N.txt", where N is hash type from hashcat

Examples:
	"MyMD5.0.txt" for MD5 hashes.
	"Uncracked.100.txt" for SHA-1 hashes.
	"Left(MyBB).2811.txt" for MyBB hashes.
	"Contest_hashes.3200.txt" for Blowfish(OpenBSD) hashes.
	etc.

3. You must have the outfile "~All.pot" in your folder;
(the outfile format is "hash:password", or "hash:salt:password").

4. The program generates the statistics for all hash lists after F5 pressing,
and creates these files in the \Temp folder:
	- The remaining hashes for each hash type (~N.txt).
	- The remaining hashes for each hash list (*.txt).
	- The dictionary for each hash list (*.dic).
	- The outfile for each hash list (*.pot).
	- The summary outfile (~All.pot).
	- The summary dictionary (~All.dic).
